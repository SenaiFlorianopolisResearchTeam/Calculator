### SUMMARY
- This study aims to develop an online platform dedicated to the analysis of road noise levels, using mathematical models and programming language. This platform aims to be an effective tool for evaluating and mitigating noise effects resulting from roads. The methodology used includes the integration of geospatial data, information on highway characteristics, traffic data and mathematical formulas to allow a precise calculation of noise levels at various points along the roads. This, in turn, will contribute to more accurate management of road noise. It is essential to highlight the relevance of this problem, as road noise significantly affects the environment and the quality of life of adjacent communities. Additionally, it is important to highlight that combating road noise is a global challenge that demands innovative approaches and the use of new technologies to minimize its negative impacts.
